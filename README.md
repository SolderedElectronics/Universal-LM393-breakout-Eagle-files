## Description and details
Universal LM393 is breakout for different sensors which are connected to the LM393 voltage comapator. According to the setting of the potenciometer and the value of connected sensor, you will get digital HIGH(Vcc) or LOW(0V) at digital output. Analog output is also available. Check schematics for details.

We have made versions of this board with: 
- LDR(light depending resistor)
- vibration sensor
- Hall effect sensor(pads are at the bottom side of PCB)
- Raindrop sensor
- Phototransistor(responses to IR light, can be used to detect fire or sunlight)

## Repository content
This repo contains Cadsoft Eagle .sch and .brd files for Universal LM393 board. It also contains schematic in .pdf created from .sch Eagle file. 
Files have been arranged into folders for navigating between different versions of board. 
Tip: layer 200 shows top silkscreen and layer 208 should be bottom silkscreen. tParts and bParts layers are not used in actual PCB.
